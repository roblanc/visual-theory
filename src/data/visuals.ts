    content: `Writing stores our life lessons and experiences.\n\nThe printing press and internet have given us access to thousands of years of lived experience.\n\nEven though we interact daily, few of us consider ourselves writers or authors.\n\nIt's difficult to be objective about our own experience.\n\nInteresting?\n\nWorthwhile?\n\nWho has the ability to decide?\n\nNo one can value it unless you do.\n\nI don't only believe this in theory; I currently live off the cash from chronicling my 10-year design career.\n\nThere's no downside to documenting your knowledge.\n\nBest case, you become a better writer; worst case, you create something that impacts others.`,

    content: `Everything begins with awareness. Awareness is cleaning yourself up. Toxicity requires a heavy clean-up. You will need to go through a purging process and combine that with internal awareness so that you can change your environments.\n\nIf you see that your friends don’t push you forward, consider changing your environment. This will also change the people.\n\nNo expectations.\n\nChanging your environment even for a brief period of time can change that perspective, that space to see things clearly.\n\nConfidence can be beneficial until it is not. There is a breaking point. When confidence is overshadowed by arrogance, a person's actions reveal their true character.\n\nSelf-compassion does not imply absolving yourself of responsibility. It all comes down to having a growth mindset that gives you genuine confidence.`,

    slug: "expectation-v-reality",
    content: `Expectation versus reality is a common theme across many cultural references and conversations. We often have expectations, but reality can often be vastly different. This is especially true when it comes to life in general. Our hopes and dreams of the future can come with a hefty dose of reality that differs from our expectations.

Take college life, for example. Many people have big expectations of their college experience. They may anticipate loads of fun, a vibrant social life, and learning experiences that will foster growth. However, in reality a college student often finds themselves buried in books, spending most of their time studying, and struggling to make ends meet.

It is important to recognize the differences between our expectations of the future and the reality of it. We can still aspire for our hopes, but it is important to stay grounded and be prepared for reality to not always match our expectations. It is also important to recognize that our expectations may not always be realistic. Being able to adjust our expectations and keep our goals in perspective can help us find the motivation and dedication needed to accomplish our dreams.

The same goes for relationships, career goals, and educational experiences. Reality can be a harsh reminder that our expectations may not always be met, but that doesn't mean our dreams should be abandoned. Instead, we must adjust our expectations and be open to reality as it presents itself. With the proper perspective and dedication, our goals and visions for the future can become a reality.`,
