    content: `Expectation versus reality is a common theme across many cultural references and conversations. We often have expectations, but reality can often be vastly different. This is especially true when it comes to life in general. Our hopes and dreams of the future can come with a hefty dose of reality that differs from our expectations.

Take college life, for example. Many people have big expectations of their college experience. They may anticipate loads of fun, a vibrant social life, and learning experiences that will foster growth. However, in reality a college student often finds themselves buried in books, spending most of their time studying, and struggling to make ends meet.

It is important to recognize the differences between our expectations of the future and the reality of it. We can still aspire for our hopes, but it is important to stay grounded and be prepared for reality to not always match our expectations. It is also important to recognize that our expectations may not always be realistic. Being able to adjust our expectations and keep our goals in perspective can help us find the motivation and dedication needed to accomplish our dreams.

The same goes for relationships, career goals, and educational experiences. Reality can be a harsh reminder that our expectations may not always be met, but that doesn't mean our dreams should be abandoned. Instead, we must adjust our expectations and be open to reality as it presents itself. With the proper perspective and dedication, our goals and visions for the future can become a reality.`,

During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a great number of artists did not pay as much attention as they ought to have to fundamental processes. They broke the rules. For example, they did not know how to properly prepare a canvas or which kinds of paints to use. In addition to disregarding artistic and aesthetic conventions, they paid little attention to the "rules" that dictate how to ensure that a painting will be preserved. The end result is that art conservators have a lot of work to do, as they struggle to prevent artwork worth millions of dollars from deteriorating. Ignoring a process because one does not fully comprehend it is reckless and naive behavior.

If I truly understand the vibrancy that results from combining two specific colors, the effect of negative space, or the operation of two-point perspective, to name just three things, then I will be able to experiment with those concepts. It is imperative that you understand that this comprehension does not have to be of an academic nature. As opposed to the technical aspects of art, the aesthetic understandings can be obtained through a variety of means, such as through non-verbal experience, intuition, trial and error, and so on.

Trying new things and bucking the trend are common themes in artistic practice. If you look at art throughout history, you'll notice that many of the new movements were an attempt to challenge the established order and the contemporary definitions of art at the time. The movements of impressionism, realism, and conceptualism, as well as looking back on the Renaissance and the transition into baroque, all take this into consideration.
