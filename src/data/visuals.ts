You will need to go through a purging process and combine that with internal awareness so that you can change your environments.\n\nIf you see that your friends donâ€™t push you forward, consider changing your environment. This will also change the people.\n\nNo expectations.\n\nChanging your environment even for a brief period of time can change that perspective, that space to see things clearly.\n\nConfidence can be beneficial until it is not. There is a breaking point. When confidence is overshadowed by arrogance, a person's actions reveal their true character.\n\nSelf-compassion does not imply absolving yourself of responsibility. It all comes down to having a growth mindset that gives you genuine confidence.`,
